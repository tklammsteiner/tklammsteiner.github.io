I am a microbiologist specializing in microbial ecology, with a strong focus on microbiome research related to digestion and microbe-host interactions. I am broadly interested in biological data science and apply advanced analytical approaches to better understand complex biological systems. Through my research, I aim to contribute new insights and practical solutions that bridge fundamental science and real-world applications.
