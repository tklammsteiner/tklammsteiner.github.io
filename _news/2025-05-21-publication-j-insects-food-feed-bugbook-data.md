This article presents a comprehensive guide to data analysis methods for insect research in food and feed production. As the insect farming sector rapidly expands, researchers face a growing need for robust, standardized analytical tools to optimize breeding, processing, genetics, and sustainability. We bridge traditional statistical techniques like ANOVA and regression, with advanced approaches such as machine learning, bioinformatics, and life cycle assessment. The guide offers practical advice for experimental design, data handling, and model selection, catering to both newcomers and experts. By consolidating methodologies across disciplines, this BugBook chapter aims to improve research transparency, foster innovation, and ensure the replicability of findingsâ€”ultimately supporting the sustainable growth of insect-based food and feed systems.
