The article sets a new standard for behavioral research in farmed insects by providing a comprehensive framework for studying the black soldier fly (<i>Hermetia illucens</i>) as a model organism. The article emphasizes the importance of clearly defining experimental intent, considering environmental and genetic factors, and selecting appropriate methodologies - from choice tests to electrophysiology - to optimize both productivity and welfare in industrial insect farming. By integrating Tinbergenâ€™s four-question framework and highlighting the need for standardized terminology and methods, this work not only addresses the complexity of insect behavior across developmental stages and rearing environments but also underscores the value of harmonized research for advancing sustainable insect production. As the first publication under the BugBook initiative, it marks a significant step toward unifying research practices and enhancing collaboration within the global insect farming community.
